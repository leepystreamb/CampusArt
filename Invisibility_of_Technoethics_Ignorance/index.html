      <p class="title2" id="start">Shaping the Scope</p>
      <p>We imagine, or even fantasise, plentiful dystopian worlds which are rooted in the
        fear of danger in ideology and technology. By proposing an acute worldview not only
        to criticise, but to ask the question: Do you really want this?</p>
      <p>In the first chapter of the dystopian novel Brave New World, the book walked us
        through the ‘manufacturer’ of the society of World State, the Hatchery and
        Conditioning Centre. A place where the World State government breeds and clones
        embryos in production lines with the advance of technology. As the tour goes on, it
        explained how implanting ‘instinctive reflexes’ of pleasures and displeasures in the
        favour of consuming products from the State, by using electric shocks to infants when
        they make contact with books and flower.
        <span id="footnote">(Huxley, 1932)<span id="reference">Huxley, A. (1932). <i>Brave new world</i>, a novel. Garden City, NY: Doubleday,

        We as the users of the internet,
        social networks, smartphones or gadgets, are the infants who get set up into an
        invisible reward-stimulation system to build our instinctive reflexes to love scrolling
        pages after pages on Facebook, binge-watching videos after videos of cats on YouTube
        and reading dozens of 140 characters journal tweets instead of in-depth journal
        articles.</p>
        <p>The invisible system in these websites or services that trains our brain, is
          embedded, hidden seamlessly with design. Design as a persuasive strategy is often
          camouflaged as free service, mapping the data mining, advertisement-centric
          business model into social networking, platforms, community, or entertainment.
          This strategy depends heavily on psychological principles, follows with knowing
          user’s behaviour patterns, it forms emotional triggers and uses social coercion to
          manipulate user’s behaviour and ‘decisions’ on those platforms.

          Keeping users to stay on their service as long as possible is one of them.

          Meanwhile, users as the citizen of informational landscapes and networks in lieu of
          serving a cooperative mean, as Jameson has addressed, they do not fully realise
          their position to ideologies such as capitalism and the network itself, as often
          times these ideologies and architecture are invisible.
          <span id="footnote">(Jameson, 1990.)<span id="reference">Jameson, F. (1990). “Cognitive Mapping”. In: Nelson, C./Grossberg, L. [ed].<i>Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture.</i> University of Illinois Press</span></span>

          When the architecture of these cyberspace is under examination, the users are
          situated in the midst of misshapen cognitive mapping, hence, exploitations through
          trained addictions to pay involuntary attention. To dissect and examine the design
          and landscape of these platforms, one has to acknowledge the capitalist attribution
          which executes through and from unbalanced power relations, in which the users are
          almost powerless.</p>
        <p>As the when The CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings declared the company is only
          competing with sleep, but not other major streaming services.
          <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/4/17/15334122/netflix-sleep-competitor-amazon-hbo" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Kafka, 2017)</span></a>
          Simply because sleeping is the only time when the mind of the user cannot be
          distracted, hijacked, or lured by social media, and its avarice for attention.
          While attention is the currency in the core of social platforms, the techniques to
          obtain one’s attention as much as possible in order to generate as much revenue as
          possible, they eminilates options but the ones to keep you, thus choices are only
          an illusion of freedom.

          As the users do not question the false
          premise of, technology is neutral, it opened a gateway for technology with hidden
          agenda, illed-intention even, to invade the boundary set between algorithm and
          users.</p>

        <p class="title2">Thought Generating Machine</p>
        <p>Personalisation as smart technology has been a key factor in digital media which
          shapes convenience around our preference. However, personalisation also creeps in
          with content-based filtering, social information filtering.
          <span id="footnote">(Bozdag, 2013, p.214)<span id="reference">Bozdag, E. (2013). Bias in algorithmic filtering and personalization. <i>Ethics
and Information Technology,</i> 15(3), 209-227</span></span>
          These types of filtering are more than caring, as the algorithm cannot detect the
          user’s value over their desire. As one chooses hamburger over salad, decisions
          which are more appealing than some, are not necessarily driven by the user's value
          and beliefs but momentarily seek for pleasure. We as users think we have all the
          control of what kind of content we consume, however, addictive design and
          personalisation always come from filtering, self-reinforcing mechanism which
          facilitates a fake sensationalism, causing a confusion between pleasures and
          fulfilment. Hence, the widespread of clickbaits, fake news which provokes intense
          emotions(then in effect, more shares and comments), or, on the contrary, mild and
          pleasing ‘non-offensive’ popularist content which deflects important discourse.</p>
        <p>The extensively employed personalisation and its recommendation system transpass
          the boundary between the human value and algorithm. As Goffey & Fuller write, ‘the
          mind is manipulated against its will by an external force; science is perverted
          against its essence by an external force’.
          <span id="footnote">(Fuller & Goffey, 2012, p.26-27)<span id="reference">Fuller, M., & Goffey, A. (2012). <i>Evil media.</i> Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.
</span></span>
          It takes over the means of self expression without exposing to the confrontational
          sides, this autonomous opinion forming can help us support views which can be a no
          match in our values.
          <span id="footnote">(Lynch, 2017, p.36)<span id="reference">Lynch, M. P. (2017). <i>The Internet of us</i>: knowing more and understanding

</span></span>
          In the capitalist sense of digital media, designs are targeted to the pleasures
          in the disguise of building personal expression of freedom with the act of sharing
          and commenting, eventually reflecting nothing but promoting or selling big
          cooperative’s value against one’s ideology. This also imposes a power difference in
          terms of knowledge, the financially privileged does not necessarily have the power to
          control the extent of how technology can work for or against their interest. Many
          services or applications provide paid ad-free options as a way of resistance to the
          mechanism of persuasion. The act of paying money still does not grant the right of
          refusing the exploitations and control but merely reducing noisy information
          distractions.</p>
        <p>While the process of transmitting and receiving ideas in digital media is
          pre-selected, or pre-digested through algorithms before they reach individuals, we
          as users then unknowingly formed a web of interpersonal ideas. Chun writes, ‘no
          control machine so far devised can operate without words,[...] it can only relies
          on external force or entirely on physical control of the mind.
          <span id="footnote">(2006, p.271)<span id="reference">Chun, W. H. (2006). <i>Control and freedom</i>: power and paranoia in the age of
fiber optics. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span></span>
          Indeed, informations in its rawest form is generated organically, however its meaning
          and intention are lost within filtered patterns and blackbox machine that could not
          understand the persuasions of words. The words did not make the order or persuasions
          powerful, the algorithm and design machine did instead. The persuasion then extends
          into real life through the uninformed human interactions. Digital media has its
          landscape set up perfectly for the trans-dimension informational cascades.
          <span id="footnote">(Lynch, 2017, p. 31)<span id="reference">Lynch, M. P. (2017). <i>The Internet of us</i>: knowing more and understanding
less in the age of big data. New York: Liveright Publishing Corporation, a

</span></span>
          If some ideas are harmful, or even evil, they convince just as well as good ideas,
          ultimately constructing a machine that generates emotion fueled, untrue, and
          unchallengeable(or unchallenged) thoughts.</p>

        <p class="title2">Communal Blackmailing</p>
        <p>In a recent episode of South Park, a child of an internet-bullied parent, Heidi
          Turner, stands over the bridge and decides to ‘end it all’ by throwing the phone
          alongside her online presence into the river. She then appeared as ‘dead’ in real
          life as she no longer participates in any social media. The humorous metaphor of
          blending of two sides of the internet self and self in real life became
          inseparable, one dies with the other. The sketch reflects the strong social
          coercion in the digital media tides and threatens us to live under spotlights and
          among ‘community’. As Chun described the webcam culture, observations and
          surveillance become the prerequisite for recognition, even existence; appearance
          and reproduced social persona have become the essence of existence: “I am seen,
          therefore I am.”
          <span id="footnote">(2006, p.278)<span id="reference">Chun, W. H. (2006). <i>Control and freedom</i>: power and paranoia in the age of
fiber optics. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span></span>
          On social media, users broadcasting fragments of their lives and provide
          observations and surveillance with the very same nature, yet in the fashion of
          sharing and connecting, the observer is also the being observed. Being seen is no
          longer adequate, recognitions do not come from just view counts, they now come in
          forms of number of likes, shares, reactions, comments; provocation is the new
          metre, the more ripples one makes, the more significant one feels. In this manner,
          we treasure our essence of existence now as: ‘I share, therefore I am’.

        </p>
        <p>Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube etc. are in
          different ways a performance platform for individuals to showcase different forms
          of acts to satisfy the needs of others. Sharing is the most crucial fuel to get
          the engine of social media working, it not only attains user’s attention and time
          to compose share-worthy content or pass things on, but it preaches the value of
          getting attention from the others. These social media platforms are no longer the
          only mastermind to keep you there, you as the user, your friends and family are
          part of the grand scheme to capture your attention in order to serve your or their
          own needs. This prosumer nature forms an interdependent social relationships within
          themselves(identity building) and with others(social approval and recognition).
          Prosumers are controlled by fear to enhance the addictive designs mechanism. The fear
          of missing out(FOMO) and the fear of missing something important(FOMSI) are the new
          courses of social anxieties developed through the tension between these internal and
          external social forces.

        </p>
        <p>FOMOs feed on the idea that we have made the wrong decision, the possibility
          where the other option is better than the one we chose, and constantly checking on
          social media to seek reassurance that we had made the better decision. However, this
          does not provide reassurance but more intense paranoia, as the users spend more time
          on sites, more events and moments they missed are exposed to them as well. FOMSIs are
          very similar to FOMOs, the fear is based on the premise that all time spent on digital
          media is beneficial when it provides useful information and opportunities(especially
          social opportunities). In fact, it takes a dozen times of scrolling and refreshing to
          see (pre-selected) news you want to read, you probably watched a few cat videos or
          read some online drama before you finally read something important. The fear drives
          the users into a constant search for benefits and opportunities one can hold on to,
          while the persuasive design tricks them into thinking the time invested in searching
          worthwhile. Users are in this situation, invest a huge amount of time and effort on
          these sites and remain unable to realise the great gap between the expectation and
          reality.</p>
        <p>The use of social reciprocity is another main strategy to encourage more
          engagement.
          <a href="https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(ibid.)</span></a>
          Users who are registered on social networks had the incentive of making
          connections through the platforms, as in the similar way of development of
          communicative technology, etiquette from face to face interaction would always
          translate into new form of communication and vise versa. The net communication
          has amplified the importance of presence, immediateness, and short span of the
          communication cycles. We accordingly make more short and frequent conversations,
          or minimal informational exchange, instead of long, in depth communication. The
          shortened cycles of our communications facilitate disturbance into our life, when
          the immediateness urges the users to respond as soon as possible because of the
          social reciprocity from traditional forms of communication, which may not be
          significant in terms of the quality of communications. </p>
        <p>The fear and anxiety as the main drive in digital media in misleading users into
          the service are serving them constructive and valuable causes. Meanwhile, the
          monopoly in big digital media firms has set up a community where we can only
          choose to either participate or to not ‘exist’, enormous amounts of time and
          attention are forced to contribute into building the community and forming social
          good. This connectedness is now in the eyes of the media enterprise as the main
          productive force, the users as the prosumers who are strongly convinced or
          persuaded, or in a sinister way, blackmailed into manufacturing in the line of
          production. We have become labourers who do not have the choice to opt out or
          suffer inevitably in solitude as punishment.</p>

        <p class="title2">Future Concerns</p>
        <p>The problems addressed above lay on the mischief of designing and technological
          flaws in morals, however, as new media are undergoing development, new design and
          technology should take consideration of the ethical impact into the process of
          developing. New media, with different infrastructure and vastly more wild
          possibilities of design and architecture can shape our cognitive behaviour,
          social dynamics and ways of communication with dramatic differences. With a
          forthcoming example, virtual reality(VR) is the new heated topic in the
          discourse of digital media. The unknown mass phenomenon which VR can cast to its
          users has yet to be discovered for developers or companies to take advantage of
          doing good or making money.</p>
        <p>While designs and technology has the space to negotiate and amend with further
          ethical control, VR embodies media environments with no fixed interface, users
          have no indicator of architecture or structures of the technology, VR can
          influence, or even invade as a passive external force into our perceptions,
          making the boundary between individual’s mind and technology more and more
          blurry. Madary and Metzinger point out, the entire environment of VR is
          determined by the creators of the virtual world, including “social
          hallucinations'' induced by advanced avatar technology.
          <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00003/full" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(2016)</span></a>
          VR then as new media becomes an uninterruptible narrative as long as there is the
          user’s participations, it generates no signals to differentiate the main
          narrative(our daily life) and the discursion of narrative(distractions from media).
        </p>
        <p>The persuasiveness of new media therefore can also be implemented in the visions
          and manipulation in a more hidden and invisible style. Researches have shown the
          embodiment of environment caused a lasting effect even the users are no longer
          participating.
          <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00003/full" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(ibid)</span></a>
          For example, in the study of 2013, VR experience with embodying avatar with
          different races avatar helped reducing the implicit racial bias.
          <span id="footnote">(Pecks and al., 2013)<span id="reference">Peck et al. (2013). Putting yourself in the skin of a black avatar reduces
implicit racial bias. <i>Consciousness and Cognition,</i> 22(3), 779-787.</span></span>
          If the new media has followed through the business model which is driven in
          attention grabbing, data mining and mind controlling in digital media, the
          effectiveness are in particularly unmeasurable cognitive shaping towards
          cooperative values. More disturbingly, the mastery of constructing a convincing,
          persuasive environment and use of the illusion of embodiment can have a positive
          effect to induce empathy, new media can also be used in mischievous causes to
          induce hatred and misconceptions. Hence, designers of the digital environment can
          become the new enforcement of doctrines, institutions and technology developers
          are lagging behind in the scheme of discussing ethical technology in order to
          protect our rights of privacy, and from being exploited.</p>
        <p>And while these discussions are encouraged to be made, one has to acknowledge
          the asymmetry in power of the knowledge in different sectors, the negotiation of
          possible consequences are then hindered in the limited realm of knowledge and
          ideological capacity. Expanding or allowing the change in commonly intuitive value
          and ethics in technology could be one of the bigger problems. The shaping of values
          then becomes intelligible and unmappable in the bias of ethical or technological
          ignorance.</p>
        <p class="title2">Conclusion</p>
        <p>The constitutionalised digital media has been proceeding with actualisation
          which parallels in the dystopian society under external control force, and the
          space for its repercussions is highly dependent on the shaping unconscious
          decisions, or shaping false and delusional decisions in the name of freedom.
          Whether or not society should allow the infinite possibility of forming
          post-contemporary ethics contradicting modern values and systematic coercion, the
          mechanism is still powered by social force in participation and engagement. The
          tension between unity and individuality as one of the key jurisdictions to
          encouraging behaviours, also lies in the democratic myth of pursuing equality
          and personal freedom at the same time. Designs and technology hijack both
          individuals and the society with the knowledge of these prerequisites and human
          psychology, then drive our existence both in real life and digital media in the
          form of commodity to serve a meta-platform. The platforms as thoughts generating
          machines represent, as Chun concluded, individual citizens’ will and actions are
          abstracted and reduced into mere statistical reactions.

          It strips the purposes of discourses and progress to steps of fulfilling corporate
          means.</p>
        <p>The users of digital media should reflect and be informed on the right of
          defying the predetermined purpose of their existence in digital media, to make
          use of it in the greater good internally and externally. However, the capitalist
          nature of digital media has prevented this right by withholding its intention and
          to commodify positive liberty as privilege while executing negative liberty in
          disguise. This deception is simultaneously assisting the totalitarianism of
          preselected values of designers and digital media platforms, as it assumes
          humankind has unified value and end in harmony same as their own.

        </p>
        <p>All sectors in digital media should address and recognise the lack of ethical
          measures. With the absence of these discussions and acknowledgement, many design
          ethicists and scholars have proposed us and platforms to have wider understanding
          of the invisible control, introducing ethical designs such as suggestions of ‘time
          well-spent’.

          However, we still and will be stuck with the dilemma of choosing between what version
          of personalised HAL 9000.
          <span id="footnote">(Kubrick, 1968)<span id="reference">Kubrick, S. (Director). (1968). <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> [Video file].</span></span>
          Do we want to be protected by HAL with incomprehensive of human values and morals,
          or by HAL with well morally guided instructions. In either way, both indicate we lack
          the ability to depict honest platforma and technology. The blending of desire and
          fantasy plants a seed of ignorant technological doctrine which may cost a long time
          or effort to debug digital enlightenment as in equivalent to the age of enlightenment.
          Or alternatively, we accept the inevitability of being ‘out of control’, we lose or
          surrender our ability to make conscious decisions, or unconsciously decide to
          submerge into being used instead of controlled, as the totalitarian modernity in
          technology has eliminated the space for resistance.</p>
        <p>The importance to visualise or expose the digital landscape is as essential as the
          potential of shifting ethics, as well as the prepositions of human value and
          existence. Our relationship as human beings with technology would have more profound
          discussions and values if we fixate on the visibility and honesty of technology at
          the contemporary stage of digital media, as the precursors of ethical guardians,
          unless we take full responsibility to jeopardise the future generation in moral
          decay, or epic changing of moral landscape. </p>
