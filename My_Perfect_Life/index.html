    <h3>Photo Series | 2018</h3>

    <div class="hidden" id="artist">
      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p><i>My perfect life</i> is a collection of photos, they were taken at home and my neighbourhood to show the imageries I encountered daily, from when I was a child to the present. These photos are my gratitude to my family, friends, many acquaintances and events that shaped who I am today.</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I’m sorry to hear that you are from a single parent family.” “If you grow too tall you won’t be able to find a guy.” “If you don’t behave, it doesn’t help even if you have good marks.” “You can’t wear flip flops to school.” “If you don’t do good in school your life will be doomed.” Since I was a child, I felt the strong oppression from the deeply rooted sociological  structure, as harmony is formed by rules and regulations, just like in art. And to this day, I still do not understand these comments on my life or myself. I had never followed or agreed to these expectations or corrections, and I am grateful for all the ‘unfortunate’ and ‘imperfect’ circumstances that gave me a free and content life.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The collection has two sets of a series of photos, one untouched, another edited into the golden ratio or symmetry. Each section has a related comment someone said to me in the mentioned period of time. The edited series acts as a retrospective representation of the fixing of my ‘misfortune’, it distorts space, lines and perspectives. And it acts as a protest to the idea of a ‘perfect normal life’.</p>

        <img src="docs/father.JPG" alt=""><img src="docs/fatherE2.jpg" alt="">
        <p>My father had my custody. I didn’t see him often because he had a company to run. My grandparents took care of me, and I got to nap and go to playground every single day. Never did I have one day that being pressed on study. I got to travel aboard every year with him since I was 6. I learned from him that there was a much bigger world.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Both of my parents felt guilty for the way it was, but I am glad that there was one less adult to boss over me.</p>

        <p>Whenever I see them, they would treat me food. My aunts and uncle are some of my favourite people.</p>

        <img src="docs/window.JPG" alt=""><img src="docs/windowE.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I could have a room by myself. But my grandma refused to throw away the rock-hard mattress in that room, so I slept in the living room to protest. Then I fell in love with the sofa and sleep on it everyday. Plus, the wifi signal is the best in the living room.</p>

        <p>My grandma is not a very good cook, she has strange rules for ingredients, like soaking pasta before cooking, rubbing cucumber to get the foam out etc.</p>
        <p>But right now, nothing comforts me more to taste her food again. </p>

        <p>I was a dumb kid in kindergarten. I lived those years in utter confusion. I remember how bad being stupid feels like.</p>
        <p>It reminds me that the wisdom and knowledge I was able to get was a blessing.</p>

        <img src="docs/primary2a.jpg" alt=""><img src="docs/primary2b.jpg" alt=""><img src="docs/Primary2ee.jpg" alt="">
        <p>My primary school was a bad school. My father applied it for me because it is the closest school to our home. I met many kids who taught me what not to do, and also some kids who taught me how not to be a little brat. I met that one kid who taught me to swear, then it never stops. The kids weren’t necessarily strong in books, so I got good grades very easily thanks to them.</p>
        <img src="docs/Primary1.jpg" alt=""><img src="docs/primary1ee.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The school was doing so bad that when I graduated from it, it closed down. The building has been abandoned for more than a decade now.</p>

        <p class="quote">“Think about your future. You won’t go anywhere if you don’t work hard in school.”</p>
        <img src="docs/Secondary.jpg" alt="">
        <p>My secondary school was a good school. It is tiny. We all share the ambition of swallowing the school for ‘bad kids’ next to us.</p>
        <p>This was where I met my gang of rebels. I wasn’t one. No point to fight with the sadistic rule makers for teenage vanity. I just stayed up at night to watch films and sleep in class during the day. Sometimes I skip school, late, or dismiss all homework. Most teachers know my name and thought I needed extra care. </p>
        <p>In the end, no one in University or in work ever cared about all the "mischieves" I've done in secondary school. </p>
      </div>

        <img src="docs/University.jpg" alt=""><img src="docs/UniversityE.jpg" alt="">
        <p>As much as I learned how to live comfortably in the lieu of criticisms, I was quite cynical about the others’ inability to see pass them. However, I now knew better that there were many ways to do things, to learn things. It is the same for all others. There is no one absolute rule to this life except being true and good. </p>
        <p>I am thankful for all the chaos and irregularities to help me to accomplish things and shape me to be who I am.</p>
