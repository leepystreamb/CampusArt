        <h3>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h3>
    </div>
        <p id="start">The premise of traditional cinema as part of the substructure of a cultural superstructure in favour of the reproduction of capitalist superstructure, and mechanical reproduction of an artwork in the course of history, served as an interface for convenience. How the reproduction of art as a convenient interface to collapse the aura of the originals by collapsing its distance. In which, till this day, this ‘interface’ for us to navigate the works of art is much more convenient and in instant, there is still a preference or fascination over the originals even though the vast copies are available in many forms. Such as the tourists who paid large sums of money to have a glimpse of the Statue of David in Florence, or Mona Lisa in The Louvre with their naked eye, to witness them with minimal loss of ‘aura’. However, using the technology, we might have a better view to look at these masterpieces in utmost detail and with dedicated focus online, high-definition photographs or even interactive forms to examine it with an even ‘purer’ manner, without the ritual and politics embedded in the artworks. And for sure, there are no crowds or flashlights from cameras constantly disrupting this process of this appreciation of a reproduction.</p>
        <p>Only when film came in the timeline of the course of mechanical reproduction, the ‘collapsing’ of aura is not the inevitable anymore in the mechanical reproduction. The cult of authenticity then transferred onto the cults of actors, the directors, the sound, the genres, and so on. Then, these cults and their aura construct a spectacle, which promotes the illusion that the proletariats are driven to obtain but could never get there. While I think this is true, the resonance of the illusion often comes from dissonance between the audience self and the film's indulgence. Let say the traditional film industry, namely Hollywood, is engineering this unobtainable desire to maintain the superstructure, how films(and video arts) can defy or simply interrupt this major trope, when the mass is trained to be repulsed by it, and not mention in most cases, the defying trope is still highly tied with a classist undertone. Like the Dadaism movement Benjamin suggested, whether it was just for the sake of art of for the sake of whatever, a politically fused art movement, refusing to partake the normality of modern life an the bourgeois, was led by a group of educated, cultured artists to say at least. </p>
        <p>Not to say the mass does not have the agency to understand art and the cinemas outside of the conventionals. Simply the superstructure,as told in the name, impossible to shake due to its very effective reinforcing cultural production. However, there is the inherent base for a normal person in modern society to navigate outside of the gatekeeping from the capitalist superstructure is technology. Technology as the opportunity to understand the process of cultural production, as the tool to obtain and participate in this mechanical reproduction of art, to collapse and create the aura, and as the stepping stone to escape the dialectic of class hierarchy in art. Video arts and unconventional cinema might as well be the byproduct of this use of technology naturally, one can use the technology to dissect a film frame by frame, enhancing, or compressing it, and one can create, regardless of the absence of fabulous costumes and precision of lighting and equipment. Beyond that, with it one can use it to challenge time, space and eventually cinema itself, expand it outside the dark movie theatre, intertwined with other mediums as it is no longer restricted by the reproducibility, it thrives on its reproducibility and its permeability. </p>

        <h3>IN Interface Ecology</h3>
    </div>
        <p class="title2">Introduction</p>
        <p>In 2013, when I was travelling in Tibet, I stumbled upon a Swastika sign (卐) on
          the floor in the Sera Monastery. Immediately felt baffled and
          uncomfortable, as I recognized this as the symbol of Nazi. One of my mainland
          Chinese travel companions, even wondered if the Nazi had influenced over Tibet.
          Since we all know, in Chinese Buddhism, Swastika is presented in 卍. I still
          remember my secondary school teacher in history class saying ‘Left turn is
          Buddhism(Anti-clockwise), Right turn is Nazism(Clockwise).’ This doubt is easily
          solved after going back to Hong Kong with a search on Wikipedia. In some streams
          of Buddhism, they use 卐. The Tibetan monastery is one of them. Afterall, it is
          a mere cultural difference.</p>
        <p>Biassed assumptions like this incident are embedded in our ‘intuitive’ thinking
          as a (uninformed)person. These are cultural assumptions, or even cultural
          intuition. Fuller states, when we use softwares or browse the web, images as a
          metaphor to hint the users of the button’s functionality.
          <span id="footnote">(Fuller, 2003)<span id="reference">Fuller, M. (2003). <i>Behind the blip:</i> Essays on the culture of software. Autonomedia. </span></span>
          With the example mentioned in text, one requires the knowledge of Sherlock
          Holmes(or the detective archetype) to understand the metaphor behind the imagery of
          magnifying glass and its symbolism as to its function for ‘searching’ in Mac OS’s
          Sherlock. While in some other general use of the same imagery, magnifying glass is for
          zooming in/out of a work surface. The magnifying glass aligned with my experience:
          the familiar symbol with very specific, sometimes unfamiliar cultural context.</p>
        <p>As Pond argues, interface can change how and what we see, even our experience and
          interaction with reality.
          <a href="http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/issue.105/15.2pold.html" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Pold, 2005)</span></a>
          When we are living in a globalised society and information age, we exchange ideas
          and cultures, assimilation comes naturally. I argue that assimilation is often
          one-sided, from the mind of UI designers to all users around the world with UI as
          the agency with absolution. The interface culture, and its imageries and languages
          transform to real life in an eurocentric authoritative manner. This type of
          homogeneity is one key factor in interface design, as we would like it to be as
          unified as possible to avoid confusion and arbitrary so we all can accomplish the
          task without errors.(or as least as possible) This cultural-technological
          uniformity, is at the same time an oblivion to marginalised groups, a gateway to
          put the untargeted cultural groups away from computers and internet, because the
          interface culture is foreign to them. </p>

        <p class="title2">Regain dominance</p>
        <p>The technology we have nowadays only solves the problems of those who are already
          using it, the neglected would have problems which the computers and networks are
          not familiar with. How can one navigates the scope of things where the eurocentric
          informative culture has not explored yet, doing tasks and solving problems which
          marginalised groups need. In claiming these cultural fields by creating an interface
          which is accustomed to these specific cultures, the images and languages of the
          interface become dominant, as to mark its cultural symbolism and significance in
          these unexplored, ‘exotic’ fields.</p>

        <p class="title2">Transcendance of Interface</p>
        <p>Interface as the medium of human and data/softwares, and the interactions between
          the two ends. In order to utilise data to marginalised groups, some of their
          cultural practices and tasks simply do not translate quite right in the aesthetic
          of minimalist, practical, sleek elements in mainstream interface. Would it be worthwhile
          to explore how well interfaces can translate the non-digitisable data and knowledge?
          In more understandable examples, online tarot cards reading as interface provide an
          interesting representation of data and knowledge to users. On most of these websites,
          by simply clicking the deck, the cards shuffle itself and the user needs to think about
          their question in mind and choose 6 cards from the deck. Once the cards are chosen, the
          user gets their result and readings back. While the input of users is ambiguous in two
          different levels: First, the interface represents neither the extent nor the feedback
          of the user's action. A disconnection with the interface in the digital model of an
          analog practice, did the user choose the cards, or the random function in the code did?
          When did randomness or “cosmic order” come in? Before the card being shuffled, or
          after the cards were chosen? The lack of feedback and visibility in the interface then
          would make the functionality of the product questionable. Second, concepts like
          emotions, feelings, or desires which are unquantifiable can be effectively counted as
          an user input/action in order to react? If the functionality of the service is not
          capable of doing so, would the interface able to transcend in just representation?</p>
        <p>Examples like this can also show that the digitalisation of things has been
          subsidising or even replacing the original. Yule Log, an US TV show showing
          nothing but burning logs for hours during Christmas. The intention was to let
          people who live in the city not miss out on the festive vibe and atmosphere as
          they do not have the space for an actual fireplace. TV as the device/screen, also
          became an interface in the household which translates the unmeasurable value and
          data as holiday spirit to the user. However, it provides nothing of its actual
          functionality, warmth.</p>

        <p class="title2">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Proposing that interface as a mere respresentation is an oversimplification
        of its significance. In terms of its utility, or its language conveyed,
        and more importantly, its culture behind it and the culture it brings upon. It is
        undeliable that the history of computer, and consequently, computer interface has
        been an eurocentric informative culture. When interface surpassed its designed
        functionality, transformed into a cultural significance, as we experience in daily
        life (from menu and decoration in restaurants to brand specific aesthetics like Apple
        products), or even cultural ritual, we need to focus on the matricity on the
        relationship between the functionality and the cultural embodiments. Designers ought
        to question whether an unauthentic representation of interface can bring a
        misguided cultural embodiment.
        <a href="https://youtu.be/YP9gEeVQZ2U" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(e.g., the American invented bamboo font in Asian restaurants of western countries)</span></a>
        Futhermore, with limitation (or benefits) of interfaces 'hiding' the complex
        mechanism being considered in the context of cultural embodiment, the technical
        formalism marks interfaces as a decisive tool, the lack of arbituary might hinder
        the wide spectrums of potential cultural and aesthetical possibility.
