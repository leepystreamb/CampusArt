      <p class="title2" id="start">“The Internet is for Porn!”</p>
      <p>A catchy song from the famous Broadway show <a href="https://youtu.be/KhCL5Ygzc24" alt="The Internet is for porn!" class="click" target="_blank">Avenue Q</a>
depicts the nature of the internet accurately. People use the internet for many purposes,
like in the song, from “trade stocks online”, “buy things on Amazon” to “send […] online
birthday card”. But mostly, for the “normal guys”, they “unzip their flies for… Porn!”.
 Undeniably, pornography was destined to become a big part of the internet. From
 printed erotica literatures, to adult magazines, phone-sex network, pornographic
 videos in forms of VHS, VCD or DVD, it naturally transforms itself into the internet.
 During the ‘Gold Rush’ period when porns started to thrive on the internet in the 90s,
 it was a ‘lucrative business’ on the internet that, Lane argues, its success spawned
 and pathed the way for the existence of sites like Amazon. Since people was initially
 skeptical towards the idea of e-commerce, the success of online commercial pornography
 confirms the otherwise. <span id="footnote">(2001, p. 114-115)<span id="reference">Lane, F. (2001). <i>Obscene profits.</i> New York: Routledge.</span></span>
And after two decades of pornography invaded yet another mass media, it is estimated the
internet hosted about US$2.9 billion worth of transactions annually. <span id="footnote">(Johnson, 2011, p.190)
  <span id="reference">Johnson, J. (2011). ‘Mapping the feminist political economy
    of the online commercial pornography industry:
  A network approach’, <i>International Journal of Media & Cultural Politics 7: 2</i>,
  pp. 189–208</span></span></p>

      <p>By reviewing the history of internet pornography, one can look into the reasons
        for making online pornography’s commercial success, was not only because ‘sex sells’,
         it was also the result of the bargaining of politics in cyberspace, internet’s
         inherent free culture, voyeurism and attention. In fact, the commercial nature
         of internet porn we see in popular streaming sites, or its misogynism many porn
         scholars argue, was actually conceived under a force with agenda of restricting
         the free and ‘lawless’ distribution platform. <span id="footnote">(Paasonen, 2011, p. 31)
         <span id="reference">Paasonen, S. (2011). <i>Carnal resonance.</i> Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.</span></span>
         IIn 1996, the Communications Decency Act(CDA) was passed to regulate pornographic
         materials on the internet, its method of using ‘verified credit cards, debit
         accounts, adult access codes, or adult personal identification numbers’ for
         protecting minors. <span id="footnote">(Chun, 2006, p.110)<span id="reference">Chun, W. (2006). <i>Control and freedom.</i> Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.</span></span>
 This act enabled the technological breakthrough of online transactions
 using credit cards, it then opened the gateway for not only spreading commercial
 pornography, but also capitalising pornography.
</p>
      <p>The essay will look into what does it cost to ‘set free’ pornography on
        the internet, through the transitions from copyright infringement, to
        dematerialisation, exploitation of labour, grassroot economy and democratisation.
        And as we experience through these transitions, the very concept of ‘free
        pornography’ in a capitalist sense and a political sense are shaping two
        polarising narratives on whether should we be optimistic and pessimistic about
        online pornography. </p>
      <p class="title2">The Communal Freebies</p>
      <p>The premise of online porn is always free, its definition has to be considered
        in the changing of ownership in the pornographic materials and the right of
        distribution. Before the US government intervention on cyberporn, pornographic
        pictures and video which were originally produced in studios were uploaded and
        shared to the internet for free, in another words, it was one of the pioneer of
        pirating cases online. During the early 1990s, the Bulletin Board System(BBS) was
        developed to allow users to upload and download files, exchange messages.
        Accompanied with the development of image scanner, users started to scan and
        exchange explicit pornographic images from adult magazines. Playboy Enterprise
        was one of the very first victims who suffered from copyright infringement online.
         <span id="footnote">(Lane, 2001, p. 62-63, 135)<span id="reference">Lane, F. (2001). <i>Obscene profits.</i> New York: Routledge.</span></span></p>
      <p>On the other hand, new types of pornographers started to pop up on the BBS and
        Usenet before the time of the World Wide Web. Among the pornography produced by
        industry professionals, these new pornographers shared their ‘homemade’ porns for
        the pleasure of their own and the others for free.
        <span id="footnote">(Paasonen, 2010, p. 139)<span id="reference">Paasonen, S. (2010). Good amateurs: erotica writing and notions of quality.

138-154). New York: Peter Lang. (Digital formations, Vol. 48).</span></span>
        This act of sharing was ‘circumventing the operating principles and
        commodity logic of the porn industry’, and meanwhile, it widened the
        ‘porn market’ by providing something mainstream porn did not have, a wild
        diversity is hence created. <a href="http://www.networkcultures.org/netporn/index.php?onderdeelID=l&paginaID=13&itemID=70" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(ibid., Tola, 2005)</span></a>
         Since the existence of amateur porn, with the diverse market it created,
         the very act of sharing free porn also laid down the foundation of capitalising
         pornography. </p>

<p class="title2">The Monopoly of ‘Free Pornography’</p>
<p>Fast forward to today’s most popular form of pornography, free online video
  pornography, is one part of the internet which occupies the most bandwidth and
  traffic. The most referenced and known pornographic sites including PornHub, Redtube,
  YouPorn, Tube 8 etc. are  actually operating under the porn giants in digital age,
  MindGeek. <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/why-are-porn-perfomers-scared-to-talk-about-internet-piracy-140413/" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(ANDY, 2014)</span></a>
The streaming sites are called ‘Tube’ sites for which they modelled their business
after the early days of YouTube for having a platform for anyone to upload video porns
(both amateur and pirated studio ones). Video sources were aggregated across the internet
as well, the videos are then often distributed without the owner’s consent/permission.
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/pornography-industry-economics-tarrant/476580/" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Pinsker, 2016)</span></a>
 The agglomerated free porns then attracted tons of traffic, there are 100 millions of
 visitors who visit MindGeek’s sites daily.
 <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/10/mindgeek_porn_monopoly_its_dominance_is_a_cautionary_tale_for_other_industries.html" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Auerbach, 2014)</span></a>
 The astronomical size of traffic then redirects the users to paid sites,
 or affiliated adult network(adult dating sites, enhancement drugs, sex toys etc.)
 which actually involves money transactions.
 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/This-is-how-porn-sitesmake-money/articleshow/48385361.cms" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Pyne, 2015)</span></a>
 The whole process is monetised through the traffic brokers.
 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/418977/how-the-internet-porn-business-works/" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Mims, 2010)</span></a></p>

<p>MindGeek owns 8 out of 10 of the biggest Tube sites on the internet, other than that,
  it also acquired many successful adult video studios(Brazzers, Digital Playground, Babes
  etc.) which the business expands itself through not just horizontal integration, but
  also in vertical integration. Meanwhile, Tube sites have been greatly attacking the
  traditional porn studios located in the San Fernando Valley. It is estimated that
  the free porns on the internet costs the industry in the valley 50% decrease in sales.
  <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/19/porn-industry-in-decline_n_2460799.html" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Moye, 2013)</span></a>
 Since the content on Tube sites were mostly pirated as stated above, both of their
 vertical and horizontal integration tactics formed such a strong network which secure
 the companies like MindGeek in a powerful position, and most of the studios in the valley
 were coerced into being in partnerships with MindGeek. These platform capitalist
 strategies hold a multi-sided market in order to maximise sufficiency of data, traffic
 and content to establish circulations and to coordinate its network effects.

capitalization of digital economic circulation. <i>Finance and Society</i>, 2 (1).</span></span>
Apart from the copyright infringement, the rise of amateur porn on tube sites shape a
short life cycle of porn products, as the porn studios have to upkeep the novelty amateurs
bring, in order to compete with them in a rapidly growing market, they have to cut cost.

<p>To the labour who work in the lower tier of the production line, such as the
  professional performers cannot escape their exploitative and competitive business
  model in this platform monopoly, as well as the net-infrastructural monopoly. Where
  both the netarchical capitalism and the distributed capitalism were practised on the
  platform of MindGeek’s Tube sites.

 These performers suffer from lower in income, partly because of competition from the
 ‘amateurs performers’, and also because of the decline in business of porn studios.
 The performers(especially female performers) were more inclined and coerced into
 escorting to diversify their source of income.

 The dilemma of these performers is, they do not benefit from the emergent distributed
 capitalism like the amateur performers do, while their benefit were being stripped away
 from the netarchical capitalism, the offender of digital piracy in the industry is the
 infrastructure of the industry itself. Some described their role in the industry as
 “Walmart drove mom-and-pop stores out of business,[...] and went into the mom-and-pop
 shops and literally stole all of their products to be resold at Walmart.”

 Although the analogy is not epistemologically perfect, the frustrations and struggles
 of performers are underlying the exploitation under the platform interference in the
 industry.</p>

<p class="title2">The Amateurs Takeover</p>
<p>The amateur pornographers are not only the emergent form of labour that is changing up
  the business model of porn industry, in fact, their ‘labour’ status was well established
  since the BBS time in the 1990s. According to Lazzaroto and Terranova who both examined
  the framework of digital economy, they dissect the role of user as ‘immaterial labour’
  in the cultural production on the internet: even the BBS amateur pornographers who put
  time, physical efforts and love to produce free porn for sharing without pay or profit,
  they produce “cultural content” that is “[...] defining and fixing cultural and artistic
  standards, fashions, tastes, consumer norms,and, more strategically, public opinion.”

Thought in Italy : A Potential Politics.</i> University of Minnesota Press. pp.
132–147.</span></span>
Before the tube sites, restrictions and regulations facilitated categorisations and a
more centralised method of indexing different kinds of porns, “narrow sexual interests”,
“unusual fetishes” or “extreme niches” started to pop up and became more visible. The many
small communities of like-minded seek out company in that way.
<span id="footnote">(Chun, 2006, p.106-107)<span id="reference">Chun, W. (2006). <i>Control and freedom.</i> Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press.</span></span>

19-22.</span></span>
And since then niches and subcategories on the internet porn scene have been more
connected than ever, in order to realise the “novelty, eccentricity or extremity” of
online porn.
<span id="footnote">(Paasonen, 2011, p.39)<span id="reference">Paasonen, S. (2011). <i>Carnal resonance.</i> Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.</span></span>
The amateurs who participated in the process of producing ‘alternative porn’, or
‘extreme porn’ while exploring their sexuality, the very act challenges traditional
commercial structure and cultural hierarchy, it re-contextualise porn in the way of
interfering social relations.
<span id="footnote">(Slayden, 2011, p. 65)<span id="reference">Slayden, D. (2010). Debbie Does Dallas Again and Again: Pornography,
Technology, and Market Innovation. In F. Attwood (Ed.), <i>porn.com: making
sense of online pornography.</i> (pp. 54-68). New York: Peter Lang. (Digital
formations, Vol. 48).</span></span>
At the same time, the subcultural communities also created a marketplace for the
‘mainstream’ capitalists to appropriate and assimilate, in a way, the amateurs and their
non-conformist porn are “being voluntarily channelled and controversially structured
within capitalist business practices.”

</p>

<p>Paasonen describes this tension between the commercial and non-commercial porn, or
  between mainstream and alternative porn functions as “tools of categorization and
  evaluation at a moment when their boundaries are increasingly elastic”.
  <span id="footnote">(2011, p.43)<span id="reference">Paasonen, S. (2011). <i>Carnal resonance.</i> Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.
</span></span>
The function of categorisation continues to be rhetorical to the evocation of desire
branded in commodity when the “You media” technology made available. Emerging digital
economy as participatory economy, attention economy or netarchial economy, encourages the
categorisations in Porn 2.0 where amateur porns took another new turn. As Mowlabocus put
it, the broadcasting culture emerging with “tags” on Tube sites becomes “a system of
categorization based on information generated by users and the one that is infinitely
expandable and adaptable. Tags allow users to form content-relations between materials
on the Web site, creating metadata, which are used to generate a ‘folksonomic’
categorisation process. This ‘grassroots’ organisation process is integral to 2.0 thinking,
 countering the ‘top-down’ taxonomic model of database management of  an earlier internet
 generation.”
 <span id="footnote">(2011, p. 71)<span id="reference">Mowlabocus, S. (2010). Porn 2.0? Technology, Social Practice, and the New
Online Porn Industry. In F. Attwood (Ed.), <i>porn.com: making sense of online
pornography.</i> (pp. 69-87). New York: Peter Lang. (Digital formations, Vol.
48).</span></span>
The “grassroot-ness” provides online pornography a more normalised representation, a real
human being with certain sexual preference rather than the radical, shocking imagery
representations they used to portrait. In addition to the mobility of pornography (wi-fi
on smartphones or ipads, contrary the necessity in the past for WLAN on PC for streaming
video), <span id="footnote">(p.77) <span id="reference">Mowlabocus, S. (2010). Porn 2.0? Technology, Social Practice, and the New
Online Porn Industry. In F. Attwood (Ed.), <i>porn.com: making sense of online
pornography.</i> (pp. 69-87). New York: Peter Lang. (Digital formations, Vol.
48).</span></span>the normalisation and popularisation of amateur porns encourage the
“prosumer” role for both the users and the content providers in terms of interactions,
where all the participants have the strength and agent to bargain and interfere the
cultural value and monetary value of internet porn and its sexual representations.</p>
<p>This form of social networking on Tube sites enhanced the level and intensity of the
  antagonism of the “prosumers”; <span id="footnote">(p. 81)<span id="reference">Mowlabocus, S. (2010). Porn 2.0? Technology, Social Practice, and the New
Online Porn Industry. In F. Attwood (Ed.), <i>porn.com: making sense of online
pornography.</i> (pp. 69-87). New York: Peter Lang. (Digital formations, Vol.
48).</span></span>
Amateurs who have an avatar/alias/character/personality presence on Tube sites as the
individualised profile and personality building were constructed of a capitalistic
resistant force, hybridating the nature of labour, work and leisure as an effort to “sell”
a persona rather than the actual porn. The amateurs prosumers on tube sites often engage
in the gonzo pornography, with a arbitrary role as proAm(professional amateur), following
some of the commercial porn conventional moves, as they consumed some of the historically
commercial nature of porn as pleasure or selling point.
<span id="footnote">(Paasonen, 2011, p.89)<span id="reference">Paasonen, S. (2011). <i>Carnal resonance.</i> Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.
</span></span>
Moreover, intentionally or not, the persona embodies more than the persona itself, when
taken the biological or gendered categorisations into the account, amateurs as the
ambassador of “authenticity” carry a great deal on the discussion of biopolitics and
gender-politics, and its sexual representations partly as a commodity and partly a
cultural product.
</p>

<p class="title2">Porntopia?</p>
<p>When categorisations emerged with the prosumers driven platform economy, scholars like
  Wilkinson, said online pornography avails the space for ideological and sexual scripts
  to co-exist healthily in feminist and democratising manner according to the laws of
  market profitability.
  <span id="footnote">(2017, p. 983)<span id="reference">Wilkinson, E. (2017). The diverse economies of online pornography: From
paranoid readings to post-capitalist futures. <i>Sexualities,</i> 20(8), pp.981-998.</span></span>
  In addition, the more diverse market and accessibility on the internet allows more
  interpersonal relationship between producers and consumers, small scales pornography
  productions allow performers or producers work in their own accord in a cooperative
  sense. <span id="footnote">(p.984)<span id="reference">Wilkinson, E. (2017). The diverse economies of online pornography: From
paranoid readings to post-capitalist futures. <i>Sexualities,</i> 20(8), pp.981-998.</span></span>
As much as many problematic depictions of porn scenes(non-consensual sex, sex violence,
inaccurate sex health information etc.), some porn professionals launched ethical.porn to
promote ethical porns which stand as a critical voice to the “harmal, misogynist,
capitalist, exploitative, racist” porn productions.
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5qkn8/makers-of-so-called-ethical-porn-hope-to-clean-up-the-industry" class="click" target="_blank"><span id="footnote">(Hay, 2017)</span></a>
As well as the emerging promotions of the worker-controlled environment can detour this
problematic sexual imagery and narrations.</p>

<p>The diversity of the ‘business models’ including ethical pornography (free pornography,
  non profit pornography, charity pornography, eco pornography, feminist pornography…)
  serves as alternative economic approaches to de-homogenise and democratise the
  mainstream capitalism in pornography. However, it does not guarantee the ‘ethical’
  approach escape the class divisions in aesthetics, sexual preference and orientation,
  gender, racial and cultural representations. Meanwhile the pessimistic reading of
  pornography doubts these alternative approaches can effectively attack the exploitative
  capitalist production, the very premise of democratisation through pornography do not
  exempt the potential exploitations in any aspect mentioned above. </p>

<p>Another crucial bias or neglect in the academic studies on internet porn was heavily
  concentrated geographically and politically in the Northern American culture, as both of
  the origin of the internet and online pornography were started in this specific cultural
  narrative. However, when addressing the complicated nature of pornography discourses,
  especially in the economic sense, also in the globalised society and global cultural
  circulations with unlimited sexual narratives and aesthetics. Take into the account of
  non-eurocentric sexual narratives and sexual representations such as Hen-Tai in Japan,
  the bodies in this production are only bodily on the consuming side, the discourse of
  ‘ethical’ and ‘anti-capitalist’ would be given a new light to interpretations outside of
  all the arguments mentioned above.</p>

<p class="title2">At Last...</p>
<p>The pessimistic reading or optimistic reading in online pornography shed critical light
  from both sides to look at the subject. The challenges can hardly be resolved in
  discussing the subject, since the negotiation between government, freedom of speech, and
  sexual liberation in the name of the legitimacy of pornography. The secretive, or
  “shameful” nature of pornography hinders the open, public and honest discourse on both
  the good and bad side of online pornography can bring to the society. The secrecy in the
  public and openness online facilitated the success of online pornography positioning
  itself as a freedom and an escape to the lawful and regulated public space(in the sense
  of economics and politics). Online pornography transcends as the exclusive,
  responsibility-free entity. Opening up the discourse would effectively engage social and
  ethical responsibility in order to give each part in this negotiation(the government,
  freedom of speech and sexual liberation) a fair power to bargain. As the capital is in
  this process, it can work as an initiative to service the part-takers to strengthen the
  bargaining force. For example, porn sites adopting ethical approach, eg. providing
  services like children protection, can be financially rewarded through social
  endorsement or government aid; effective labour unions for performers who work in
  traditional porn studios; government regulations to help combat copyright infringements
  on tube sites(as to help movie studios). The monetary interference in the “dirty”
  attribute of pornography can be the most appropriate solution: “Sex sells”, and
  “Money talks”.</p>
